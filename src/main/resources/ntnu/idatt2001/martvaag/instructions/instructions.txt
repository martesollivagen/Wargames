1. In order to simulate a battle you need two armies. These you can create in three different ways:

     a. Create your own army by using the input fields on the left. You can only create one own army
        with maximum 10 000 units, and then use it against for example one of the pre-made armies.

        You can see information about the different unit types by clicking on the "Select unit type"
        text next to the button where you choose the unit type.

        You have to choose a unit type, the health value and number of units to add have to be number,
        and your unit name cannot be empty. This you can repeat until you are happy with your army:)

     b. Download an army by using the 'Download army from file' button on the right. The file has to
        be a csv file with the right format in order to work. If you are having trouble, try to create
        a new csv file wit the content from your file and try again

     c. Choose from pre-made armies by using the 'Choose army' buttons on the right

2. Once you have found two armies they will appear in the two white textfields at the top of the page, and
   you are able to view all the units in the armies simply by hovering over the textfield of each army.
   You can also now choose terrain and simulate a battle. You cannot simulate a battle between two equal
   armies (if they have the same name).

3. After the simulation, the winner will show in the middle, and you can again view all the units left in each
   army after the battle by hovering over the text fields. After each battle you have to reset the armies, and
   then you can either do another simulation with the same armies and terrain, or choose new ones.

4. If something else should go wrong, try to read and understand the error messages provided. If you are
   still having trouble, try to close the application with the 'Quit application' button and start over.



   Enjoy!!
